# Line Visualization
I visualized the movement of the buses running in NYC in the morning on February 12, 2019. 
The bus records are gathered from the MTA website. Each line shows a movement of a bus between one record and another. 
The line color was decided base on the travel distance between the records: red and orange color indicates long-distance travel, and blue means a short distance trip. 
This simple, beautiful visualization gives us a way to understand the pattern of bus trips in NYC.
